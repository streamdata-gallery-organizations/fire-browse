  title: Fire Browse Beta API Retrieve all thresholded by genes Gistic2 results.
  description: 'This service provides access to the Gistic2 all_thresholded_by_genes.txt
    output data. A gene-level table of discrete amplification and deletion indicators
    for all samples. A table value of 0 means no amplification or deletion above the
    threshold. Amplifications are positive numbers: 1 means amplification above the
    amplification threshold; 2 means amplifications larger to the arm level amplifications
    observed for the sample. Deletions are represented by negative table values: -1
    represents deletion beyond the threshold; -2 means deletions greater than the
    minimum arm-level deletion observed for the sample. Results maybe filtered by
    cohort, gene or barcode, but at least one gene or barcode must be supplied.'

      description: 'This service provides access to the Gistic2 all_data_by_genes.txt
        output data. This data is a gene-level table of copy number values for all
        samples. The returned copy number values are in units (copy number - 2) so
        that no amplification or deletion is 0, genes with amplifications have positive
        values, and genes with deletions are negative values. The data are converted
        from marker level to gene level using the extreme method: a gene is assigned
        the greatest amplification or the least deletion value among the markers it
        covers. Results may be filtered by cohort, gene, or barcode, but at least
        one gene or barcode must be supplied.'
